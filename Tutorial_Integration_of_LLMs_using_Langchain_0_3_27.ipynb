He will receive an annual salary of $120,000, health/dental insurance, and a 4 % 401(k) match, along with 20 vacation days. Either party may terminate the agreement with a 30‑day notice. The contract also imposes a 6‑month non‑compete restriction within 50 miles in the same industry. While the core terms are clear, the document omits several common clauses (e.g., probation, severance, IP rights, bonus/equity, remote work policy) and includes a potentially restrictive non‑compete that could limit future employment opportunities. These gaps should be reviewed and, if necessary, negotiated before signing.\n"

If a malicious user supplies a string, list, or other non‑numeric value, a `TypeError` will be raised. In a larger application this could crash the service or expose stack traces. | Low | • Add explicit type checks (`isinstance(price, (int, float))`).<br>• Reject or coerce non‑numeric inputs early. <br>• Use `decimal.Decimal` for monetary values. |\n",

            "1. **Add Type Hints and Validation**\n",

            "\n",

            "   * Catch `InvalidOperation` when converting user input to `Decimal`.\n",
            "   * Return user‑friendly error messages or error codes rather than raw tracebacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Limit Acceptable Ranges**\n",

            "\n",

            "   ```\n",
            "   * Ensure logs are rotated and stored securely.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Access Control (if exposed via API)**\n",
            "   * Verify that the caller has permission to apply discounts.\n",
            "   * Use role‑based access control (RBAC) or attribute‑based access control (ABAC).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Unit Tests & Static Analysis**\n",
            "   * Write tests covering edge cases: negative numbers, > 100 % discounts, large values, non‑numeric inputs.\n",
            "   * Run tools like `bandit`, `mypy`, or `pyright` to detect any hidden issues.\n",
            "\n",
